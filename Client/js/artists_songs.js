I'm seconds\r\nbehind, behind my own pair of mind you see I gotta catch up if I want to be\r\nfound in me. Holding my brain that looks like going insane I feel like Dorian\r\nGrey and I'm out of the frame.  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nMake a false move bitch I make you fall like Niagara Falls, big and hairy\r\nballs, hear my calls, break the dolls. Mr. Hyde breaking out from my fucked up\r\nmentality read the news tomorrow another lyrical fatality. Lurking in the\r\nshadows I wait for my pray to come. Striking from the darkness I invite you\r\nall to get some. Tall dark and handsome I hold your kids for ransom. Psycho\r\nmotherfucker I'll be famous like the Hansons. London after dark feel me\r\nbreathing down your neck, sending chills down your spine hear my microphone\r\ncheck one time two time three times. Here it comes. Your life is nothing now\r\ndust you off like bread crumbs.\r\n\r\n",
